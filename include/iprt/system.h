/**
 * Queries the amount of RAM that is currently locked down or in some other
 * way made impossible to virtualize within reasonably short time.
 *
 * The purposes of this API is, when combined with RTSystemQueryTotalRam, to
 * be able to determine an absolute max limit for how much fixed memory it is
 * (theoretically) possible to allocate (or lock down).
 *
 * The kind memory covered by this function includes:
 *      - locked (wired) memory - like for instance RTR0MemObjLockUser
 *        and RTR0MemObjLockKernel makes,
 *      - kernel pools and heaps - like for instance the ring-0 variant
 *        of RTMemAlloc taps into,
 *      - fixed (not pageable) kernel allocations - like for instance
 *        all the RTR0MemObjAlloc* functions makes,
 *      - any similar memory that isn't easily swapped out, discarded,
 *        or flushed to disk.
 *
 * This works against the value returned by RTSystemQueryTotalRam, and
 * the value reported by this function can never be larger than what a
 * call to RTSystemQueryTotalRam returns.
 *
 * The short time term here is relative to swapping to disk like in
 * RTSystemQueryTotalRam. This could mean that (part of) the dirty buffers
 * in the dynamic I/O cache could be included in the total. If the dynamic
 * I/O cache isn't likely to either flush buffers when the load increases
 * and put them back into normal circulation, they should be included in
 * the memory accounted for here.
 *
 * @retval  VINF_SUCCESS and *pcb on success.
 * @retval  VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED if the information isn't available on the
 *          system in general. The caller must handle this scenario.
 * @retval  VERR_ACCESS_DENIED if the information isn't accessible to the
 *          caller.
 *
 * @param   pcb             Where to store the result (in bytes).
 *
 * @remarks This function could've been inverted and called
 *          RTSystemQueryAvailableRam, but that might give impression that
 *          it would be possible to allocate the amount of memory it
 *          indicates for a single purpose, something which would be very
 *          improbable on most systems.
 *
 * @remarks We might have to add another output parameter to this function
 *          that indicates if some of the memory kinds listed above cannot
 *          be accounted for on the system and therefore is not include in
 *          the returned amount.
