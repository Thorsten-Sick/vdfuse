vdfuse
======

Virtualbox VDI files fuse mount tool. From https://sourceforge.net/projects/xspect3d/files/gordstuff/

My goal is to get it compatible to the newest virtualbox version and add some features. Maybe it can be push to virtualbox repository sooner or later.

Building
========

You will need the virtualbox sourcecode. Please load the package from their homepage

bash vdbuild_net /path/to/virtualbox/source/include/ vdfuse-v82a.c
